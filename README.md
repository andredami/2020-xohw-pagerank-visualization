# d3-ngrx-test

Testing how angular can be wired with d3 and ngrx.

## setup

1. clone this repository
2. move to this repository
3. `npm install`
4. `ng serve`
5. open your browser on http://localhost:4200

If you want to run canvas version instead of svg, move to `canvas` branch: `git checkout canvas`. Canvas version is faster.
